        "\n",
        "Regression modeling is a mathematical method that helps us understand relationships between data points and make predictions. 📈 For example, if we want to estimate something for the future—like how much a customer might spend per visit—we can use a regression model to find an approximate value.\n",

        "### 🧮 **How Do We Estimate?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to predict a customer’s “sales per visit” based on:\n",
        "- **Days between purchases**\n",
        "- **Credit card use** (whether the customer has a credit card or not)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**:  \n",
        "A customer shops every 333 days and does not have a credit card. Plugging these details into the model, we estimate their sales per visit at **$128.13**. However, the actual amount they spent was **$184.23**.  \n",

        "#### 📝 Prediction Error:\n",

        "1. **Standard Error of the Estimate (s)** - This predicts the typical error in our predictions. Based on our data, it’s **$87.54**. This is relatively large since our data lacks some details that could improve accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** - This calculates the average error between predicted and actual values. Here, MAE is **$53.39**, indicating a $53.39 average difference between predictions and actual values.\n",
