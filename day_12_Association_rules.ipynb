        "## Introduction to Association Rules\n",
        "Imagine a rule like this: **“If a customer buys bread, they also buy butter.”** This is an Association Rule. We use it to find patterns in data, like which products are often bought together in shopping carts.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if people who buy \"diapers\" also often buy \"beer,\" this insight can help stores arrange items or plan promotions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Terms\n",
        "- **Support**: The percentage that shows how often both items (like bread and butter) are bought together across all transactions. For example, if bread and butter are bought together in 10 out of 100 transactions, the support is 10%.\n",
        "- **Confidence**: Measures how often the second item (like butter) is bought when the first item (like bread) is bought. If this happens in 8 out of 10 cases, then the confidence is 80%.\n",
        "- **Lift**: Tells us how much better our confidence is compared to random chance. For example, if lift is 2, it means the chance of buying butter when bread is bought is twice as high as buying butter randomly.\n",
        "- **Antecedent**: The condition part (the first item, like bread) in an association rule.\n",
        "- **Consequent**: The outcome or the item we are predicting (like butter).\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Mine Association Rules Using Python\n",
        "In Python, finding association rules is easy using the `mlxtend` library's `apriori()` function. Let’s say we’re working with a dataset called `transactions`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Prepare the Data\n",
        "First, load the data and convert it into a one-hot encoded DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "Now, use the `apriori()` and `association_rules()` commands to find the rules.\n",
